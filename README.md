# The Fundamentals of CPlusPlus

In this repository, I will share you some basic things about *C++* that I know. Hope these will be helpful for you.

## Let talk about C++

C++ is a popular general-purpose programming language that was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 as an extension of the C programming language. It is an object-oriented, compiled, and statically-typed language that is widely used in a variety of applications, including operating systems, web browsers, games, and more.

C++ is known for its performance and flexibility, as it allows developers to write code that is close to the hardware and to optimize it for specific use cases. It also supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms, making it a versatile language that can be used in many different contexts.

## Basic thing that I have learned in C++ programming

Here are some basic concepts that you should learn when starting to program in C++:

1. **Variables**: A variable is a named location in memory that you can use to store a value. In C++, you need to specify the type of a variable when you declare it, such as an integer, float, or string.

2. **Data types**: C++ has a variety of built-in data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and strings. It also allows you to define your own custom data types using structures and classes.

3. **Operators**: Operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values. C++ has a variety of operators, including arithmetic operators, comparison operators, and logical operators.

4. **Control structures**: Control structures allow you to control the flow of your program, including conditional statements (if/else), loops (for, while), and function calls.

5. **Functions**: A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called from other parts of your program. Functions can accept parameters and return a result.

6. **Arrays**: An array is a collection of variables of the same data type that are stored in contiguous memory. Arrays allow you to store and access multiple values at once.

In addition to the basic concepts that I mentioned earlier, there are many other topics that you can learn as you continue to develop your skills in C++. Some of these topics include:

7. **Object-oriented programming**: C++ supports object-oriented programming (OOP), which is a programming paradigm that organizes code into reusable objects. OOP allows you to define classes and objects, as well as to implement inheritance, polymorphism, and other important OOP concepts.

8. **Memory management**: C++ has a variety of tools and techniques for managing memory, including pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and reference variables. Understanding how to effectively manage memory is important for writing efficient and robust C++ programs.

9. **STL**: The Standard Template Library (STL) is a collection of templates and algorithms that are commonly used in C++ programs. The STL includes containers, iterators, algorithms, and other useful tools that can make it easier to write C++ programs.

10. **Templates**: C++ templates allow you to write code that can work with a variety of data types, making it easier to write generic and reusable code.

11. **Exception handling**: Exception handling is a mechanism for handling runtime errors and other exceptional situations in C++ programs. It allows you to write code that can gracefully handle errors and exceptions, rather than crashing or producing unexpected results.

> These are just a few of the many topics that you can learn as you continue to develop your skills in C++. There is always more to learn and explore in programming, and the best way to improve is to practice and try out new ideas.

## What are the main part of the repository?

The repository mainly focuses on studying various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and heaps, and how to implement and test them in C++. Additionally, it covers a range of algorithms that operate on these data structures, including search algorithms, sorting algorithms, graph-based algorithms, and tree-based algorithms. The project aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the different data structures and algorithms and their implementation in C++.

## Usage

The Cplusplus Fundamentals repository is a collection of essential data structures and algorithms implemented in C++, with accompanying test cases and examples. The repository is designed for anyone looking to improve their understanding of foundational programming concepts and improve their skills in C++. You can use the code and docs as a reference for implementing and testing data structures and algorithms in your projects, or as a way to practice and improve your coding abilities.

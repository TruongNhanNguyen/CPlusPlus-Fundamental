# Brute-Force Algorithms

Brute force algorithms, also known as exhaustive search or generate and test algorithms, are a class of algorithms that systematically enumerate all possible solutions to a problem and check their feasibility. They are characterized by their simplicity and generality, as they can be applied to a wide range of problems, but their high time and space complexity often makes them impractical for large inputs.

Some examples of problems that can be solved using brute force algorithms include:

- **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: Enumerating all possible permutations of the cities and checking the distance of each one.
- **Sudoku**: Checking all possible numbers for each empty cell and verifying that it is a valid solution.
- **N-Queens Problem**: Checking all possible positions of queens on a chessboard and verifying that no two queens threaten each other.
- **Knapsack Problem**: Checking all possible subsets of items and their values and weights to find the one that maximizes the value while staying within the weight limit.

It is worth noting that Brute force can be efficient for small inputs, but for larger inputs it can be infeasible.

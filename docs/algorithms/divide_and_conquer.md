# Divide and Conqueur Algorithms

Divide and Conquer is a general algorithmic strategy for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller, simpler subproblems and combining the solutions of those subproblems to find the solution to the original problem. The basic idea behind divide and conquer algorithms is to divide the problem into smaller subproblems, solve each subproblem independently, and then combine the solutions to the subproblems to solve the original problem.

Some examples of divide and conquer algorithms include:

- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Binary Search
- Closest Pair of Points
- Strassen's Matrix Multiplication
- Karatsuba Multiplication
- Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
- Binary Exponentiation
- Divide and Conquer based Dynamic Programming (such as Matrix Chain Multiplication, Longest Common Subsequence)
- Median of two sorted arrays

Each of these algorithms work by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and recursively solving them. The solutions of the subproblems are then combined to find the solution to the original problem.

# Greedy Algorithms

A greedy algorithm is a simple, intuitive algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. In other words, a greedy algorithm makes the best possible decision at that moment, without worrying about the consequences of that decision on future steps.

Some examples of problems that can be solved using greedy algorithms include:

- Huffman coding for data compression
- Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph
- Prim's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph
- Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph
- Activity selection problem
- Huffman decoding
- Fractional knapsack problem

It's important to note that while greedy algorithms can be very efficient and easy to implement, they do not always produce the optimal solution for a given problem. This is because a greedy algorithm's choices may depend on the current state of the input, without considering the consequences of those choices on future states. It is important to prove that the greedy strategy will lead to globally optimal solution for the problem at hand.

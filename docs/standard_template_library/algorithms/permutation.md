# The STL Permutation Algorithms

Permutation algorithms are used to rearrange the elements of a container or range in various ways. Here are some examples of permutation algorithms in the STL:

1. `reverse`: This algorithm reverses the order of the elements in a range. It takes two iterators as arguments, indicating the beginning and end of the range to be reversed. Here is an example of using `reverse` to reverse a vector of `integers`.

2. `rotate`: This algorithm rotates the elements in a range by a given number of positions. It takes three iterators as arguments, indicating the beginning and end of the range to be rotated, and the position to which the elements should be rotated.

3. `random_shuffle`: This algorithm shuffles the elements in a range randomly. It takes two iterators as arguments, indicating the beginning and end of the range to be shuffled. Here is an example of using `random_shuffle` to shuffle a `vector` of integers.

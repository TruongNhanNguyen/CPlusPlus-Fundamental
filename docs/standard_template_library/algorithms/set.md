# The STL Set Algorithms

Set algorithms are used to perform set operations on containers and ranges, such as union, intersection, and difference. Here are some examples of set algorithms in the STL:

1. `set_union`: This algorithm computes the union of two sorted ranges and stores the result in a third range. It takes three iterators as arguments, indicating the beginning and end of the two input ranges and the destination range.

2. `set_intersection`: This algorithm computes the intersection of two sorted ranges and stores the result in a third range. It takes three iterators as arguments, indicating the beginning and end of the two input ranges and the destination range. 

3. `set_difference`: This algorithm computes the difference of two sorted ranges and stores the result in a third range. It takes three iterators as arguments, indicating the beginning and end of the two input ranges and the destination range.

# Tree

A tree is a commonly used data structure that is composed of nodes and edges, with the following properties:

- Each tree has a single node called the root node, which does not have any parent.
- Each node, except for the root node, has exactly one parent node.
- Each node can have zero or more child nodes.

There are several types of trees, each with their own specific use cases. Some of the most common types of trees include:

- **Binary Trees**: Each node in a binary tree has at most two children.
- **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)**: A binary tree where the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its left children, and less than or equal to the values of its right children.
- **AVL Trees**: A type of binary search tree where the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one.
- **Trie**: A tree-like data structure that is used for efficient string matching and insertion.
- **Heap**: A special type of binary tree where the parent node's value is either greater than or equal to its children's values (max heap) or less than or equal to its children's values (min heap).

Each type of tree has its own specific use cases and advantages, and it is important to choose the right type of tree for the task at hand.
